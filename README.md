# Jansson android mobile app: A visual novel.

This is the final project for Mobile Development -course Spring 2025 at Haaga-Helia University
of Applied Sciences. The project was developed by Kaj Jansson.

Jansson decided to develop a visual novel app, i.e. an interactive storybook with visuals,
audio and other technical components such as saving and loading progess.

Note that I renamed the "visual novel app" as VN_APP.
