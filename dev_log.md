# Dev log / Learning diary
According to course requirements, every students must write their learning
experience about their mobile development, in form of diary (or developer's log).

Note that the diary can only be maximum two pages. In order to remember better 
each progress that I have made during development, I decided log all small decisions
and changes from every working days in the appendix 1.

In other words, this diary is splitted primarily in two chapters:
**1. Summary** - A short and cohesive essay, where I answer most important
subjects according the course requirements such as _difficulties during development,
tools that helped me during development, what resources I use,_ etc.
**2. Appendix 1 : Work report** - A loose and "free form" notebook, where I
record specific day's work and results.
