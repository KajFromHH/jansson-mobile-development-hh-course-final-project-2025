# Dev log / Learning diary

According to course requirements, every students must write their learning
experience about their mobile development, in form of diary (or developer's log).

Note that the diary can only be maximum two pages. In order to better recall or
remember each progress that I have made during development, I decided log all 
small decisions, processes and changes from every working days in the separate 
document _appendix_1_for_dev_log_.

In other words, this learning diary (i.e. **dev_log.md**) is a short and cohesive essay, 
where I answer most important subjects according the course requirements 
such as _difficulties during development, tools that helped me during development, 
what resources I use,_ etc.

Meanwhile **appendix_1_for_dev_log.md** is a loose and "free form" notebook, where I
record specific day's work and results. Additionally I write a lot of thinking
and planning process, inspired from outside / third party sources such as 
AI tools like Co-Pilot, professional articles and official tools' documents.
Note that I shall only use AI tools for simple question, problems and opinions,
_**but not for developing whole project as a rule of the course!**_


## 1. What kind of mobile app did I develop, and why?

## 2. What tools and libraries did I use?
